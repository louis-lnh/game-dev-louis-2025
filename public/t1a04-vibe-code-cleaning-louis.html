You need to put the cleaned code here. No CSS, no confusing divs and paragraphs. Just as simple as possible webpage html. <br><br>

If doing javascript script are the variables sensibly named using camelCase "myVar" etc dont use promises (.then) instead use async/await, 
no addEventListeners unless necessary, get ChatGPT to make the changes. More Changes... Only simple javascript nothing fancy.

Here is the original vibecode<br>

Final comments: Any obervations about your code compared to the VibeCode<br>
